# Sweden-Airports-distance measurement on folium map package in Python
This is repository showcase all my past python codes, i have written in python in the area of data science

This code is welcome to be modifeid as it is an open source tool, but give credit where necessary.

It was designed for quick penetration of electric flight in sweden as it provides a quick way of planning and visualizing the distance an electric aircraft can cover before needing a charge.
The map displays the number of airports available in different counties of sweden. 
The map can measure area and distance between airports accurately

This will be useful in future planning of charging spot location for the aircrafts as the higher the number of airports in a county the higher the charging spot location required.
